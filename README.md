# Cuckoo Watchtower

Cuckoo Watchtower (CW) is an application developed to assist with malware forensics investigations and reporting using Cuckoo. It leverages GPT-4, a large language model by OpenAI, to revolutionize the malware analysis process. CW utilizes json report files from Cuckoo Sandbox outputs to provide dynamic, chat-bot style insights into malware data, all from within a Google Colab environment.

## Features

- **Data Integration**: CW processes JSON reports generated by Cuckoo Sandbox, breaking them down into manageable text files that cover general, signature, network, and static analyses.
- **Enhanced Accessibility with RAG**: Utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the LLM's context understanding, significantly improving the accuracy and relevance of the generated reports.
- **Vector Database Storage**: Integrates with Weaviate, an open-source vector database, to store and retrieve analysis vectors efficiently, allowing for advanced search capabilities.

## Use Cases

- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive, easy-to-understand reports tailored to various audiences, which can include specific parameters such as report format, audience type, and length.
- **Interactive Querying**: Allows users to ask follow-up or clarifying questions about the malware analysis, enhancing understanding and aiding further investigation.
- **Assistance in Pivoting**: Aids analysts in pivoting during investigations, leveraging the model's ability to quickly search and display relevant information.

## Limitations

- **Data Handling**: Due to limitations with data size constraints from OpenAI, not all collected data can be processed, requiring selective data usage.
- **Model Constraints**: Current implementation constraints mean alternative models may need to be considered for operational environments due to sensitive information handling.

## Future Work

- **Data Expansion**: Planning to incorporate additional data sources from Cuckoo into the RAG pipeline to enhance model responses.
- **Integration with Cuckoo Scans**: Exploring possibilities to integrate direct Cuckoo scan capabilities to streamline additional malware analyses.
